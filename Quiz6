caith
# Q1
# "caith" contains comparisons between two different variables.
# They appear to be hair and eye color.
# Q2
EyeColor <- rowSums(caith)
#EyeColor contains the total amount of people with each color eye
# Q3
HairColor <- colSums(caith)
# Q4
hist(EyeColor)
# This histogram does not show amounts of each variable, since
# it is qualitative data
# Q5
caitha <- as.matrix(caith)
# This changes "caith" from a data frame into a matrix
# Q6
barplot(t(as.matrix(caith)))
# This function creats a barplot showing the total amount for each
# eye color, with a breakdown of each by hair color as well, however
# it does not label each individual hair color
# Q7
barplot(t(as.matrix(caith)), beside = TRUE)
# Q8
cor(EyeColor, HairColor)
plot(EyeColor, HairColor)
# I do not see any relationships between hair and eye color from
# looking at the charts. Attempts to use R code to find relationships
# were unsuccessful as they do not have equal numbers of variables.
